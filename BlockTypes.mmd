    %% Colors %%
    %% Rationale: Green is often associated with "action," "go," and "processing," which fits the nature of execution blocks that actively transform or process data.
    classDef green fill:#28a745,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
    %% Rationale: Blue is often associated with "organization," "grouping," and "collective operations." It provides a calm, structural feel, appropriate for blocks that group or batch items.
    classDef blue fill:#2374f7,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
    %% Rationale: Orange is often linked with "storage" or "holding" phases and is visually distinct. Buffer blocks temporarily store items before they are processed, so orange can indicate this intermediary state.
    classDef orange fill:#f28c28,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
    classDef light-yellow fill:#fffacd,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
